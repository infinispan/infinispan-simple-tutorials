= Kubernetes and Openshift tutorial

This tutorial contains instructions on how to run Infinispan library mode (as a microservice) in Kubernetes/OpenShift.

Prerequisites: Maven and Docker daemon running in the background.

== Setting up OpenShift

OpenShift Origin has a command line client called `oc` (it can be downloaded https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[here]).

The client allows you to spin up a local cluster (of course this is not recommended for production but for testing, it's perfect). In order to do that you need to invoke:

```
oc cluster up
```

== Setting up Kubernetes

It is also possible to run this tutorial on Kubernetes. Installing a local cluster requires downloading and installing Minikube (detailed instruction might be found http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/[here]).

Unfortunately Kubernetes installation does not use have installed any Docker registry by default. The easiest way to overcome this problem is to use Minikube's Docker environmental variables:

```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

== Configuring Service Account for KUBE_PING

Since https://github.com/jgroups-extras/jgroups-kubernetes[KUBE_PING] Discovery Protocol requires viewing all Pods in the OpenShift Project, you need to add additional privileges to the OpenShift:

```
oc login -u system:admin
oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:myproject:default -n myproject
```

== Switch to a normal user

After the OpenShift is running, you need to login as a `developer`. That's the standard role you should always be using:

```
oc login -u developer -p developer
```

== Building this tutorial

This tutorial is built using maven command:

```
mvn install
```

Note that `target/` directory contains additional directories like `docker` (with generated Dockerfile) and `classes/META-INF/fabric8` with Kubernetes and OpenShift deployment templates.

TIP: If the Docker Daemon is down, the build will omit processing Dockerfiles. Use `docker` profile to turn it on manually.

== Deploying this tutorial to the Kubernetes/OpenShift

This is handles automatically by Fabric8 maven plugin, just invoke:

```
mvn fabric8:run
```

== Viewing and scaling out

Everything should be up and running at this point. Now login into the OpenShift or Kubernetes web console and scale the application our or in.

Just in case you were looking for Kubernetes scaling command:

```
kubectl scale --replicas=3  rs/$(kubectl get rs --namespace=myproject | grep infinispan | awk '{print $1}') --namespace=myproject
```

And the one for OpenShift:
```
oc scale --replicas=3  dc/$(oc get dc --namespace=myproject | grep infinispan | awk '{print $1}') --namespace=myproject
```

Enjoy!
